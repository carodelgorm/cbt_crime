# CBT in Correctional Settings 

This repo uses data from the Criminal Justice Drug Abuse Treatment Studies 
(CJ-DATS) Series to examine, at an exploratory level, the reported availability of 
mental-health and other treatment approaches related to Cognitive Behavior Therapy 
in correctional settings, as reported by Treatment Program Directors. 

Data are downloaded directly from https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/NAHDAP/studies/34988 
and the survey data that plots these initial, unweighted responses are from the Survey 
of Treatment Program Directors (S3B), whereas other data within this series also 
surveys Executives of carceral and related settings, Administrators, and staff.
